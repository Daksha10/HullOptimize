**SCP(Shipment Container Placement) by Convex Hull Computation using Graham Scan**

This C++ project implements the Graham Scan algorithm to find the convex hull of a set of 2D points. By utilizing vectors and sorting algorithms, this project efficiently computes the convex hull, visualizes container placement, and prints the convex hull points. This tool is particularly useful for geometric optimization in logistics and computational geometry applications.
